I am a post doc in the department of astronomy at Peking University / the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Beijing, China. I am working with Prof. Eric Peng and involved in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) now. My research is focused on understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies based on their globular cluster systems. My thesis includes the kinematics of intracluster globular clusters in the Virgo Cluster and photometric and spectroscopic surveys of globular clusters in the merger remnant galaxy M85. I got my Ph.D from Seoul National University, supervised by Prof. Myung Gyoon Lee.
