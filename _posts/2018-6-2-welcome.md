I am a post doc in the department of astronomy at Peking University and the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Beijing, China. I am working with Prof. Eric Peng and involved in the [Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey](http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~lff/NGVS/Home.html) now. My main research topic is to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies based on their globular cluster systems. I got my Ph.D from Seoul National University, supervised by Prof. Myung Gyoon Lee. The thesis topics are globular cluster systems in the Virgo and the merger remnant galaxy M85.
